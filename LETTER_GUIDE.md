</p>
```

  From our late-night talks about [topic] to your adorable obsession with cows
  üêÑ, every little thing about you makes my heart smile.
</p>

<p>
  Your [specific quality], your [another quality], and the way you [something
  she does] ‚Äì these are just a few of the countless reasons I fall more in love

</p>
```

### Add Future Plans

  our dinner at Eve on Adams. Here's to many more adventures together.
</p>
